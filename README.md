# rock-paper-scissors-basic-functionality-on-console

Create a new function named getComputerChoice.
Write the code so that getComputerChoice will randomly return one of the following string values: “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.
Hint: The Math.random method returns a random number that’s greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. Think about how you can use this to conditionally return one of the multiple choices.

Step 3: Write the logic to get the human choice
Your game will be played by a human player. You will write a function that takes the user choice and returns it.

Create a new function named getHumanChoice.
Write the code so that getHumanChoice will return one of the valid choices depending on what the user inputs.
Hint: Use the prompt method to get the user’s input.

Step 4: Declare the players score variables
Your game will keep track of the players score. You will write variables to keep track of the players score.

Create two new variables named humanScore and computerScore in the global scope.
Initialize those variables with the value of 0.
Step 5: Write the logic to play a single round
Your game will be played round by round. You will write a function that takes the human and computer player choices as arguments, plays a single round, increments the round winner’s score and logs a winner announcement.

Create a new function named playRound.
Define two parameters for playRound: humanChoice and computerChoice. Use these two parameters to take the human and computer choices as arguments.
Make your function’s humanChoice parameter case-insensitive so that players can input “rock”, “ROCK”, “RocK”, or other variations.
Write the code for your playRound function to console.log a string value representing the round winner, such as: “You lose! Paper beats Rock”.
Increment the humanScore or computerScore variable based on the round winner.
Example code:

Step 6: Write the logic to play the entire game
Your game will play 5 rounds. You will write a function named playGame that calls playRound to play 5 rounds, keeps track of the scores and declares a winner at the end.

Create a new function named playGame.
Move your playRound function and score variables so that they’re declared inside of the new playGame function
